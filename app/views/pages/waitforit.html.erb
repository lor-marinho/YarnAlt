  <p><strong>HI!</strong> Thanks for dropping by. <br>
  This web app was the proud outcome of a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp we attended <strong>@ Le Wagon</strong>. <br>
  We want to redo it and make it a much better experience.<br>
  Hopefully a beta version will come up soon. <br>

  If you would like to show some support, contact us at <br>
