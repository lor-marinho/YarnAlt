  <p><strong>HI!</strong> Thanks for dropping by. <br>
  This web app was the proud outcome of a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp <strong>@ Le Wagon</strong> we were a part of. <br>
  Today we are way more equipped than we were when we started building this app. <br>
  We want to work on it and make it a much better experience.
  Hopefully a beta version will come up soon. <br>

  If you would like to show some support, feel free to reach out! <br>
